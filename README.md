# TriangleCountingAPI

This is the code I implemented for my final year MSci project. Its an api which provides a few ways of counting the number of triangles in large graphs. The main method contains a cli that was inplemented using the api, but I wouldn't really recommend using it as it was something I rushed at the end of the project.
